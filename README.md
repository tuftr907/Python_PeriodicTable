The program displays buttons for each element, with each button labeled with the element's atomic number. 
The color of each button corresponds to the color associated with the element. 
When a button is clicked, it triggers a function that displays a messagebox containing information about the corresponding element, such as its symbol and name. 
The information displayed in the messagebox is fetched from a predefined dictionary containing data about various chemical elements. 
The code creates an interactive periodic table GUI for exploring basic information about chemical elements.
